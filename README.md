# 🎄 Follow Along as I attempt [AdeventofCode](https://adventofcode.com/)🎄

My personal goal for this is get more familiar with Python! Hopefully I will explore more languages later...
+ [Advent of Code 2022](2022/)

+ [Advent of Code 2021](2021/) - I burnt out pretty quickly this year, so I will NOT be staying up every night doing these 

+ [Advent of Code 2020](2020/) - I only made it to day 3 this year 😅
